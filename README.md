# Gin Base

A template of clean architecture with gin framework, go-fx as dependency container, gorm as orm for database related operations.

To learn about project structure and dependency injection please go through [here](https://medium.com/wesionary-team/dependency-injection-with-go-fx-b698a6585cf0?source=friends_link&sk=26f391ae41c493946ee3434be2ed4971)

## Running the project

- Make sure you have docker installed.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Run `docker-compose up -d`
- Go to `localhost:8080` to verify if the server works.
- [Pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) Database Management runs at `5051` .
- [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) Database Management runs at `8081` 

If you are running without docker be sure database configuration is provided in `.env` file and run `go run . app:serve`
